# waldo-anticheat
A project that aims to use optical flow and machine learning to visually detect cheating or hacking in video clips from fps games. 
Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/GOI9EkLsUm0) discussing the purpose and vision of WALDO.

# Notes
* This project is still under development. 

## The What
A new market for cheats that are visually indistinguishable to the human eye have lead to a rise in "closet hacking" among streamers and professionals.
This form of cheating is extremely hard to detect. In some cases it issible to detect, even with today's most advanced anti-cheat software. 

We will combat this new kind of cheating by creating our own deep learning program to detect this behavior in video clips.

## The How
Because of the advanced technology used, the only reliable way to detect this form of cheating is by observing the cheating behavior directly from the end result- gameplay. Our goal is to analyze the video directly using deep learning to detect if a user is receiving machine assistance.

Phase 1 focuses primarily on humanized aim-assist. Upon completion of phase 1, WALDO's main function will be vindication and clarity to many recent "hackusations."
